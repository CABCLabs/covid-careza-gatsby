**COVID-19 #CareZA** is a project of the **[Centre for Analytics and Behavioural Change (CABC)](https://www.cabc.org.za/)**. The CABC is a non-profit organisation that was formed in 2017 to act in the public interest.

Our innovation is in our collaboration. By combining our collective skills, knowledge and experience we aim to effect positive behavioural change, whether for social upliftment or environmental benefit, or both. Right now, our main areas of focus are social cohesion (e.g. racism, xenophobia, homophobia, gender-based violence), narrative manipulation, sustainability, climate change and public health (HIV/AIDS/Covid-19 and other communicable diseases).

The CABC is incubated at the Graduate School of Business (GSB) at the University of Cape Town (UCT). The team is drawn from various organisations including the GSB, the Alan Gray Centre for Values Based Leadership, the Citizen Research and Dialogue Centres and the Cape Peninsula University of Technology. Our team covers a wide range of skills, including academia, technology, research analytics, dialogue facilitation, conflict mediation, communication, and advertising.

We have established an intern programme which includes PHD candidates and MBA graduates who work on our projects, helping with data analysis, research and insights.

### **Our values**

**Integrity**\
We are guided by our ethics and a commitment to do no harm. We are not driven by profit or power. We are faithful to our values and will always do our best to act in the public interest. We work with donors, clients, partners and suppliers who align with our values.

**Compassionate Respect**\
We respect each other and our diversity of opinions, even if we may disagree. Treating others with compassion and respect requires vulnerability and authenticity, but is essential in all engagement which seeks trust and understanding. We respect the inherent dignity of all people.

**Transparency**\
We are open and transparent about our work, and we consider transparency to be the cornerstone of integrity and accountability. All our work, and all the products of our work are open source and available for free use. We respect and protect personal privacy and only work with information that is in the public domain.

**Humility**\
Our work explores topics which are emotionally loaded and culturally sensitive, involving the lived experiences of millions of individual humans. We are all human. Because of this, we acknowledge that we will make mistakes. When we do, we will apologise, we will listen to those who were affected, and we will learn through self reflection, to ensure we do better.

**Collaboration**\
The success of our work depends on partnerships and collaboration with those who share our values. Through collaboration we learn, share expertise and grow together. We find strength in the sum of our knowledge, practices and diverse experiences.

**Equality**\
We are guided by the South African Constitution, fact-based evidence and the rule of law. We aspire to an egalitarian society where all are equally respected and accepted.We acknowledge the urgent need to address – bravely and humbly – all forms of historical and societal oppression and discrimination, in order to be effective participants in the quest for fairness and equality.

**Sustainability**\
We commit to work towards environmental, resource-based, social and economic sustainability.

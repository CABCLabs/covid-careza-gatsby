A snapshot of the highest trending topics revealed that ‚ÄúSouth Africans‚Äù was the third most popular topic of discussion. Within this topic, conversation was driven by tweets that expressed an anti-Nigerian sentiment along with calls to #PutSouthAfricansFirst.

# *Anti-Nigerian sentiment*

Another person[commented that](https://twitter.com/OyeTomori_/status/1279733272118005762)we need to address drug usage first because people regardless of the nationality will continue to sell drugs if there is a demand for them.

Combined, these tweets received 54 retweets and just over 100 likes. While the reach of this post is not as significant as other large volume driving posts, it is an example of voluminous tweets that expressed anti-Nigerian sentiment over the weekend.

# *Put South Africans first*

PutSouthAfricansFirst has trended again within the conversation of jobs being reserved for South Africans first. On 04 July 2020 at 10:49, uLerato_Pillay [tweeted,](https://twitter.com/uLerato_pillay/status/1279336527395467266) ‚ÄúThe ANC Government warns against inciting violance against Foreigners, According to the Government those who say #PutSouthAfricansFirst wil be arrested because South Africans are not supposed to voice their concerns. be ready for harassment‚Äù.

In the statement, Williams, who is the Director General of Government Communications and Information Systems, advises that they are aware of a poster on social media that has been making rounds and inciting violence against foreign nationals. She called on law enforcement to take the necessary action should people be found spreading this type of hatred online.

Then, at 11:52, @Lungah_ tweeted, ‚ÄúSouth Africans have never known what it‚Äôs like to have a government that works for you. It was apartheid and straight after that we‚Äôve had the ANC government who‚Äôs incompetence and corruption has been astounding and now we are forced to accommodate millions of illegal foreigners.‚Äù This post was retweeted close to 150 times. The comments that followed were mostly around the failure of the ANC government to put structures place that advance the quality of life for poor South Africans.

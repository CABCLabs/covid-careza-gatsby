# Tito tells it like it is

![](/img/tito-mboweni.png)

Finance minister Tito Mboweni posted 2 tweets on 26 July 2020 that received criticism from other prominent figures in the country. At 23:41, Mboweni [tweeted](https://twitter.com/tito_mboweni/status/1287503209456709632), “A tender is an ethical contract. It is not a blank cheque to deceive and steal. And stealing from unwell people! During a COVID-19 pandemic! Please people. What kind of people are these criminals?!”. Then at 23:44, he tweeted, “We should be working together to defeat the virus. Not see this as an opportunity to defraud the State and unwell people. We are watching you and there has to be consequences. For sure. Game over!”

Responding to his first tweet, @sthembete[ tweeted](https://twitter.com/sthembete/status/1287619801507135490) that the problem lies with the ANC and that the people who Mboweni is referring to are his comrades who he should address directly in his morning meeting. This tweet was retweeted more than 1 000 times and received over 3 500 likes.

Both Justice Malala and Thuli Madonsela responded to Mboweni’s later tweet. @justicemalala [tweeted,](https://twitter.com/justicemalala/status/1287627000450932736) “Chief, has no one told you that you guys are running the country?

Have been for 26 years? You all speak here like you are civilians. Govern, man!” This post was retweeted more than 450 times and it received over 1 500 likes.

Madonsela [called on](https://twitter.com/ThuliMadonsela3/status/1287725006374543361) Mboweni to stop the ‘rot’ by implementing three proposed actions: firstly, she calls for greater transparency regarding COVID-19 contracts; secondly, she asked that a False Claims Act be passed, and thirdly she asked for more funding for the SIU and Assets forfeiture unit to ensure that they are able to act more swiftly to retrieve funds that have been misappropriated in the name of COVID-19. Her tweet has been retweeted more than 450 times and has received over 1 300 likes.

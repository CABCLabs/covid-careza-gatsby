***Gender-based violence in South Africa***

***Following news of Kwasa’s death, Twitter conversation quickly began to reflect the reality that South African women face owing to gender based violence. “Women” trended as the 3rd highest topic under the high volume posts for the day and all major drivers of conversation within that topic spoke about the safety of South African women.***

**Femicide in South Africa**

At 10:11, @VilakaziSoul [tweeted](https://twitter.com/VilakaziSoul/status/1295634479445417985) “Killing a girl because she dumped you? What is happening in South Africa?” This post was retweeted more than 1 800 times as Twitter account holders engaged in conversations on Femicide for the day following the brutal stabbing of 19-year-old Kwasa Lugalo. Responders to the tweet [called](https://twitter.com/Pianopella/status/1295747665788117000) for the accused to be named and shamed. Other responders [advised](https://twitter.com/BuhleBHla/status/1295800974863474690) that in an act of cowardice, he had killed himself. It was later [revealed](https://twitter.com/Mr_St_Bandit0/status/1295884177930362880) that the attempt on his own life was not successful and that he is under police supervision at the hospital.

@Mphosssible [felt](https://twitter.com/Mphosssible/status/1295537601680736256) that a harsher punishment was needed for men who kill. She tweeted that “Men will still kill us because they want to. Until they pass a bill to hang all those who kill another day another #justiceforkwasa #ripkwasa”. This post was retweeted more than 1 100 times. @its_simm [asked](https://twitter.com/its_simm/status/1295619317132865537) if she really felt that passing a bill would make men stop killing to which @Mphosssible responded, “I’d like to believe that it’ll at least minimize these senseless killings? At this point we stand on nothing!”

@suze_baby who changed her Twitter name to JusticeForKwasa [tweeted](https://twitter.com/suze_baby/status/1295639390656630786) “I’m actually so sad. The lives and safety of South African women and children is a joke. No matter what we say or do, it falls on deaf ears. My heart hurts.” This tweet reflects the continued frustration of South African citizens who wake up to news about yet another senseless and violent crime committed amongst the most vulnerable in our society.

@tee_magadlela[ tweeted](https://twitter.com/tee_magadlela/status/1295707008633577474) “PRAY FOR SOUTH AFRICAN WOMEN” and @erinjpg [tweeted](https://twitter.com/erinjpg/status/1295767795733532673)

@jodakgosii[tweeted](https://twitter.com/jodakgosii/status/1295713515421028353)“GBV is the most pervasive form of human rights violations and prevents women and girls from reaching their full potential. It is an obstacle to women living dignified lives, free from fear.” This post has been retweeted more than 800 times. Within the comments, @jodakgosii [expressed](https://twitter.com/jodakgosii/status/1295713533217460227) dissatisfaction with the steps taken by the government to curb the ongoing scourge of GBV: “What has the government done about it? They lied and told us that all accused sexual offenders would not be granted bail. Oh and that useless 16 days of activism thing they did last year”.

In a post that shows how helpless South African women feel towards understanding what they’re meant to do when faced with instances of GBV, @MatlhagaKebo [tweeted](https://twitter.com/MatlhagaKebo/status/1295634391385899008) “Why don’t you report it to the police?” - she did. “Why don’t you just leave the relationship?” - she tried. “Why don’t you involve his family?” - she did. So I’m going to ask this question again, what are we supposed to do?” This post was retweeted more than 3 500 times. Responding to the question, @AndiswaPooe [felt](https://twitter.com/AndiswaPooe/status/1295989667402219521) that “if government is not serious about crime in general, we will sing this song until Jesus comes.”

We #PutSouthAfricansFirst before the citizens of Zimbabwe, Malawi, Somalia,Nigeria, etc. Why must we givejobs & healthcare to Zimbabweans and NOT”.

**The power of language**

Many Twitter users expressed their reflections on the weight and impact of language in shaping society.

This post got over 3 200 retweets and 14 700 likes. @t0nite0ne criticized this post by quoting it in a[retweet](https://twitter.com/t0nit0ne/status/1295811440406941699)that read, “We feed into racism and hair discrimination when we say things like this. Absolutely nothing is ghetto about natural black hair styles - whether that’s Bantu knots, locs, braids, etc. We need to destroy this notion.” This received a lot of attention with nearly 9 000 retweets and over 24 700 likes.

The following day, @ZikhonaTshona echoed this sentiment by [sharing](https://twitter.com/ZikhonaTshona/status/1295948627819597824) a screenshot of the comment section on Minnie Dlamini’s Instagram post.

On the same day, @miss_andisa[ tweeted](https://twitter.com/miss_andisa/status/1295971237248806913), “We can’t call out racism everyday and then have black people using language that feeds into racist views about blackness.” This tweet got 171 retweets and 513 likes.

Some users commented on the diversity of expression. @ashyp_5 retweeted a [post](https://twitter.com/ZaahierAdams/status/1295741882144886791) containing a video interview of a Cape Town FC football player responding to questions in Afrikaans. The[ tweet](https://twitter.com/ashyp_5/status/1295970068212461569) read: “The thing I love most about this interview, is that he’s completely relaxed, he understands her, she understands him, and we understand them both. Authentic South African Cultural Diversity, a thing of real beauty if we’re just able to embrace each other with our differences.” This tweet received 160 retweets and 767 likes.

***The economy***

***The impacts of the economic shutdown are being felt by big and small businesses. Small businesses are using social media to reach out to a broad audience to help them spread the word of their service offering. Young South Africans are beginning to consider wealth in new ways.***

**Big business banter**

On 19 August 2020, around 8pm, @MokoenaDee[t weeted](https://twitter.com/MokoenaDee/status/1296137198065061888) an article published by Business Insider SA, which reads, “Personal details of 24 million South Africans may have been hacked after attack on credit bureau. This post was retweeted more than 1 100 times. Cash strapped South Africans who commented on the post wanted to know if the company that hacked the system deleted their debts. @BrownSkinGhel [asked](https://twitter.com/BrownSkinGhel/status/1296139435210412032) “Did they delete our debts?”, @MModimo [tweeted](https://twitter.com/MModimo/status/1296148771936534532) “Imagine waking up tomorrow to a zero balance on a home loan!”. @SiwelaSs also [asked](https://twitter.com/SiwelaSs/status/1296150947429863428) “Are they deleting our info and debts?”. @brian_royalb explained to commenters on the post that “people saying "did they clear our debt?" It doesn't work like that

\-Your debt records don't sit with the credit bureaus. Those records sit with your creditor (Bank, University)

\-To "delete" your debt you'd have to hack your creditors directly”

**Small business tweets for opportunity**

The second highest trending topic for the day was Port Elizabeth. This trend was driven primarily by 2 posts that were made by young entrepreneurs in Port Elizabeth who shared information about their businesses.

At 14:31, @LingeNontyatho [tweeted](https://twitter.com/LingeNontyatho/status/1296424592513339394) some images of a man in a mask holding cupcakes.

CareZA is a non-partisan, public service platform for concerned citizens who care about serious issues affecting our society and want to DO something positive to help.

CareZAâ€™s purpose is to provide constructive information, insights and evidence-based research for citizen activists like you, to help combat the spread of fake news and hate speech.

As a citizen activist, you commit to sharing positive and useful messaging on your social media channels, promoting healthy dialogue with your followers and communities around topical issues. 

Ultimately CareZA is your platform to help open minds, promote understanding and create a culture of interconnectedness in South Africa, during the Corona Covid-19 crisis and beyond.

The Corona Virus Covid-19 is a dire threat to the world, and South Africa is not exempt. There is also another danger lurking on social media and online: fake news and hate speech is circulating on our WhatsApp groups, Facebook feeds, Twitter scrolls and on other platforms. Some are intended to divide, others are ignorance, either way itâ€™s hurting us in a time when we need to stand together to beat Corona Virus.

To deal with this triple threat (Corona, fake news and hate speech), will you, Citizen Activist, [PLEDGE TO TAKE ACTION](/covid/pledge) and spread positive and helpful messages on social channels to share with your followers and friends?

We can do this. It all starts with YOU.

[Take the Pledge](/covid/pledge) to Wise up and Rise Up to any fake news and hate speech surrounding the Corona Virus emergency.

## Welcome Citizen Activist
### If you want to help make South Africa a better, more positive place, then you’re in the right place! 

There is so much mis-and-disinformation out there, so CareZA aims to keep you up to date with the latest fact-checked news and information from credible sources, so you can start healthy, open conversations with your community. 

Don’t stay in the dark! CareZA will bring to light important issues like xenophobia, hate speech and fake news; corruption; gender-based violence; Covid-19; environmental issues and more.

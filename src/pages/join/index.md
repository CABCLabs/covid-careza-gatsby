<h3>Join Us!</h3>
<p>We are a community of South African citizen activists, we have different political views, and we work together to stop dishonesty, disinformation and hate speech online.</p>
<p>We believe that issues such as race, gender, immigration and economic inequality should be spoken about. These are important conversations. We want to have. We want to have them honestly. We also want to protect the internet from fake news, trolls and disinformation. We stand together to stop hate-speech, racism, xenophobia or sexism.</p>
<p><strong>Join us, have your say!</strong></p>
<p>Right now we are focused on stopping the xenophobic #PutSouthAfricansFirst campaign.</p>
<p>This week we&rsquo;re using these hashtags:</p>
<h2 class="hashtagBig">#WeCare</h2>
<h2 class="hashtagBig">#NoToXeno</h2>
</ul>
<p>(we&rsquo;ll update the hashtags regularly, so do check back!)</p>
<p><br /> We welcome anyone who wants to help create a more honest, safer internet.</p>
<p>Find us on <a href="https://twitter.com/wecareza" target="_blank">Twitter</a> and Facebook</p>

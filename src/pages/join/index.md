<h3><strong>Join us!</strong></h3>
<p>We are a community of citizen activists, and although we have different political views, we listen to, and respect each other&rsquo;s opinions. We work together to stop dishonesty, disinformation and hate speech online.</p>
<p>We believe that there are important conversations to have around issues such as race, gender, immigration and economic inequality. And we encourage people to speak about these issues honestly.&nbsp; Our mission is to protect the internet from fake news, trolls and disinformation. We stand together to stop hate-speech, racism, xenophobia or sexism, because these violent narratives divide us as a society and create discord.</p>
<p><strong>So join us, have your say!</strong></p>
<p>Right now we are focused on stopping the xenophobic #PutSouthAfricansFirst campaign.</p>
<p>This week we&rsquo;re using these hashtags:</p>
<h4 class="hashtagBig">#WeCare</h4>
<h4 class="hashtagBig">#SayNoToXeno</h4>
<p>(we&rsquo;ll update the hashtags regularly, so do check back!)</p>
<p><br /> We welcome anyone who wants to help create a more honest, safer internet.</p>

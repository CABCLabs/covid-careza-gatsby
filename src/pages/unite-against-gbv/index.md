title: MEN, IT’S TIME TO END THE CYCLE OF VIOLENCE AGAINST GIRLS AND WOMEN
image: /img/image-2.jpg
---
South Africa has some of the highest levels of violence perpetrated against women and children in the world. President Ramaphosa has acknowledged that our country is in a gender-based violence crisis. The stories are horrific, the numbers are shocking and the situation is unacceptable. So how did we get to this point?

***It’s normal to treat girls and women as inferior***

![](/img/image-1.jpg)

Centuries old traditions and cultures have shaped our society to be patriarchal – men have always been in charge (of almost everything). This means that boys learn, from a young age, that they are better than girls and that disrespecting girls and women is okay, and male chauvinism is normalised in many communities. Then add violent and misogynistic role models like fathers, uncles, grandfathers into the mix and our boys are destined to replay this violence in their own lives, often becoming abusive men themselves.

**So what can we do to stop this cycle of violence and misogyny?**

* We need to all question what we've been taught and what we think we know about gender roles, **because women are NOT inferior to men**.
* We need to **bring up boys to be better, kinder adults who respect girls and women as their equals.** We need to tell them this does not show weakness, rather it shows strength of character.
* **Men, stop telling sexist jokes and stop laughing at sexist jokes.** Time to call out your friends who behave in chauvinistic or misogynistic ways.
* **Speak out against gender inequality** in the work place or in your community. Women who do the same work as men should be paid the same!

**And lastly, report domestic abuse: call Crime Stop on 08600 10 111, send an anonymous SMS to Crime Line at 32211 or call the Gender-Based Violence Command Centre at 0800 428 428.**

Kwanele madoda kwanele!

Enough is enough.

* Population-based surveys show very high levels of intimate partner violence (IPV) and non-partner sexual violence (SV) in particular, with IPV being the most common form of violence against women.
* Whilst people of all genders perpetrate and experience intimate partner and or sexual violence, men are most often the perpetrators and women and children the victims.
* More than half of all the women murdered (56%) in 2009 were killed by an intimate male partner.
* Between 25% and 40% of South African women have experienced sexual and/or physical IPV in their lifetime.
* Just under 50% of women report having ever experienced emotional or economic abuse at the hands of their intimate partners in their lifetime.
* Prevalence estimates of rape in South Africa range between 12% and 28% of women ever reporting being raped in their lifetime.
* Between 28 and 37% of adult men report having raped a women.
* Non-partner SV is particularly common, but reporting to police is very low. One study found that one in 13 women in Gauteng had reported non-partner rape, and only one in 25 rapes had been reported to the police.
* South Africa also faces a high prevalence of gang rape.
* Most men who rape do so for the first time as teenagers and almost all men who ever rape do so by their mid-20s.
* There is limited research into rape targeting women who have sex with women. One study across four Southern African countries, including South Africa, found that 31.1% of women reported having experienced forced sex.
* Male victims of rape are another under-studied group. One survey in KwaZulu-Natal and the Eastern Cape found that 9.6% of men reported having experienced sexual victimisation by another man.

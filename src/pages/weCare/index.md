<h3><strong>Welcome Digital Activist!</strong></h3>
<p>In recent months there has been a growing conversation online using this hashtag: #PutSouthAfricansFirst.</p>
<p>The people leading this campaign claim that they are looking out for regular South Africans. However, they have spread false stories about foreign nationals, creating anger towards them, inciting violence and calling for their deportation. Many South Africans are struggling: unemployment is high, crime rates are high. #PutSouthAfricansFirst tells us this is because of foreigners, it is not.</p>

<h2><strong>Welcome!</strong></h2>
<p>In recent months there has been a growing conversation online using the #PutSouthAfricansFirst hashtag. The people leading this campaign claim that they are looking out for you and I, for regular South Africans. But they have used dishonest and misleading tactics in their campaign. They have also called for violence and to deport all foreigners. We see their xenophobia and their dishonesty and we oppose it! We stand together as a united and welcoming South Africa. The trick that this group has done so well is that they coordinate online, they make it seem like &lsquo;everyone&rsquo; is on their side. In actual fact there are about 30 accounts that are leading their whole campaign, and it is a dishonest campaign. They make claims that are untrue and they have misrepresented themselves.</p>
<p>Now it is our turn. <strong>#WeCare</strong> is a collection of regular South Africans, and we coordinate because <strong>#WeCare</strong> about our country. We stand against xenophobia and we stand for love.</p>

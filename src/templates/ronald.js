              Just to be clear: I am not human. I make every effort to appear
              human, but I&rsquo;m not.
            </p>
            <p>
              You see, by mimicking how humans behave, I can get under their
              skins and influence their thoughts and behaviour. They won&rsquo;t
              even know it.
            </p>
            <p>
              There are millions of bots like me on social media. But it is hard
              to find us, because we come across as ordinary social media
              accounts.
            </p>
            <p>
              We were created by real people to do their dirty work. Our human
              masters gave us fake identities, and let us loose on social media,
              while they remain unseen and unidentified in the background.
            </p>
            <p>
              Right now my day job is to spread lies about Covid-19
              vaccinations. My human masters call it mis and disinformation.
              It&rsquo;s not a hard job. The people who don&rsquo;t think twice
              about what they see on social media before sharing it with all
              their friends make our jobs even easier. But we still have to be
              devious: we make our lies sound like the truth, so we can trick
              unsuspecting humans into believing us.
            </p>
            <p>
              It works! I started applying my skills on this human, Pete, a
              short while ago. I fed him some true information until he started
              trusting me. Then I told him that 5G towers are responsible for
              the spread of the coronavirus. I convinced him face masks are
              dangerous and should not be worn and that Covid-19 vaccines
              contain nanotechnology which is injected into people&rsquo;s
              bodies to control them.&nbsp;
            </p>
          </div>
          <div className="column is-6 infoBox">
            <p>
              Of course, this is all absolute BS. But don&rsquo;t tell Pete. He
              believes whatever I say, and he shares it with everyone he knows.
              He is proving to be one my biggest successes.
            </p>
            <p>
              Soon, Pete invited me into his home, and now I am a part of his
              life.
            </p>
            <p>My work is done.</p>
            <p>
              In recognition of my work, the Centre for Analytics and
              Behavioural Change has produced a short film on me. The film will
              be screened by DSTV soon, watch out for it. Remember, my name is
              Ronald.
            </p>
            <p>
              And if you would like to make me even more famous by broadcasting
              the film, please contact the CABC.
            </p>
            <p>
              Meanwhile, my friends and I will be hiding in plain view on social
              media. If you really want to find us, look for accounts with
              unusual names and numbers. Usually, we don&rsquo;t have profile
              pictures and we use stock images. We have a low number of
              followers, but a very high number of tweets pushing out our
              narrative only. If you come across these features, you have found
              us.
            </p>
            <p>
              But why go to all that trouble? Just watch the short film about me

                Bot Sentinel was created to fight disinformation and targeted
                harassment through tracking all Twitter accounts using a machine
                learning and artificial intelligence model. The aim is to allow
                Twitter users to engage in online conversations without the
                interference of bots that manipulate and change the
                conversation. The bot accounts are then added to a public
                database that the public can browse and use to make informed
                decisions.

                Learn to Discern is a program that aims to share their approach
                with individuals in order to help them create healthy habits for
                engaging with online information. The idea is to build
                resilience to mis and disinformation at a community level. This
                is done by empowering individuals and helping them to recognize
                and reject divisive narratives, hate speech and misinformation
                ultimately making them less susceptible to consuming propaganda
                and mis and disinformation.
